<p>Airbnb’s first New York listing was in Harlem in the year 2008, and the growth since has been exponential. This animation helps visualize Airbnb’s growth in New York over the years. Around 600 properties were added in the first couple years, mostly in Manhattan and Brooklyn.  Downtown Manhattan and close lying areas in Brooklyn have always had high Airbnb presence. The number of listings has roughly doubled each year since then. By the year 2015, every neighborhood of Manhattan had a multiple listings. Interestingly Bronx has very few listings, so few that the Manhattan-Bronx border can be seen in the animation by the sudden drop in listings. Since 2016, Airbnb listings have spread to parts of Staten Island. The animation also makes it easy to see the trend in listing counts; a prediction of 70k properties by 2020 shouldn’t be far off.</p>
