Project analyzing Airbnb Rental data

Welcome to the Exploratory Analysis of the Airbnb Dataset! You can let us know if something isn't clear at any one of these addresses : ap3772@columbia.edu (Ankit), sg3637@columbia.edu (Sarang) and aa4229@columbia.edu (Ankita). 

Here's a few pointers to keep in mind when running the code :

i). We are still in the process of uploading all data files. We're looking for ways to work around the max file size limit. 

ii). The data files that have been uploaded are compressed versions since they exceed Github's 100Mb limit. You'll need to extract these files before you run the code.
